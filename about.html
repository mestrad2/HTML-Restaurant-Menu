        <p>In 2014, HTML student John Estramonte met fellow student Anong Wang. They bonded over the extremely rich flavors of hot and spicy, sweet and sour, and the boldness of contrasting flavors found in the 
            Thai cuisine served in Anong's family restaurant. Two years later Anong inherited the family restaurant after her parents decided to return to Thailand. Looking to revive the atmosphere of the restaurant 
            and entice a younger crowd into exploring the bold flavors of her native culture, she took inspiration from her now husband, John and renamed the restaurant to H-Thal-ML.</p>
        <p>H-Thai-ML combined the traditional flavors of Thai Cuisine with local ingredients. John and Anong partnered with local farms and butchers in North Carolina to serve local grown foods infused with Thai flavors. 
            John and Anong revitalized H-Thai-ML by customizing their menu to change with the seasons. "Using fresh, local ingredients allows us to serve the most bold flavors and dishes all year round" says Anong. In 
            addition to tangy and savory dishes, H-Thai-ML offers flavorful sticky rice desserts infused with local grown fruits and many more bold flavors.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Anong has taken her vision to a variety of locations around the United States. Not only is she able to bring the bold flavors of Thailand to guests around the United States but she is able to 
            combine a variety of ingredients native to the expanded locations. So next time you find yourself in Charlotte, New York, Seattle or Houston, stop and enjoy Thai cuisine at H-Thai-ML</p>
